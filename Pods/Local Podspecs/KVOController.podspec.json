It offers a simple, modern API, that is also thread safe.\n                      Benefits include:\n                      Notification using blocks, custom actions, or NSKeyValueObserving callback.\n                      No exceptions on observer removal.\n                      Implicit observer removal on controller dealloc.\n                      Thread-safety with special guards against observer resurrection.\n                      \n                      Single class: FBKVOController\n",
